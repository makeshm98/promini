# Arduino Pro Mini Microcontroller

The Arduino Pro Mini is a compact, low-power microcontroller board based on the ATmega328 (or ATmega168 in older versions). It's designed for small and lightweight projects where space and power consumption are crucial.

## Key Features

1. **Microcontroller:** ATmega328 (or ATmega168)
2. **Operating Voltage:** 3.3V or 5V (depending on the version)
3. **Clock Speed:**
   - 16 MHz for the 5V version
   - 8 MHz for the 3.3V version
4. **Digital I/O Pins:** 14 (of which 6 can be used as PWM outputs)
5. **Analog Input Pins:** 6
6. **Flash Memory:** 
   - 32 KB (ATmega328) of which 2 KB is used by the bootloader
   - 16 KB (ATmega168)
7. **SRAM:**
   - 2 KB (ATmega328)
   - 1 KB (ATmega168)
8. **EEPROM:** 
   - 1 KB (ATmega328)
   - 512 bytes (ATmega168)
9. **Communication:** UART, SPI, I2C
10. **Power Supply:**
    - Can be powered via the RAW pin (up to 12V) or VCC pin (3.3V or 5V depending on the version).
11. **Size:** Very small, roughly 33 x 18 mm.

## Power Options

- **RAW pin:** This pin allows you to supply unregulated voltage (up to 12V), which the onboard voltage regulator will then convert to the appropriate operating voltage (3.3V or 5V).
- **VCC pin:** Directly supply the board with regulated 3.3V or 5V.

## Programming

It doesnâ€™t have a built-in USB interface like other Arduino boards, so you'll need an external FTDI or USB-to-serial adapter to upload sketches.

## Common Uses

Due to its small size and low power consumption, the Pro Mini is often used in embedded projects, wearable devices, sensor networks, and other applications where space and power are limited.
